                        <p class="comment-text">On the First day of our NVQ we created our first html webpage using a program called phpstorm. Once our main index.html page was created we use a very basic structure and also set the doctype. The doctype describes to the document the document type definition i.e a particular version of HTML. In the index.html we added several elements which includes a header, a paragraph, a table of contents and a link. The paragraph was defined with the p tags.
                            The header was the largest size of header so it was defined as an h1 tag. The next addition was a table of contents which starts off with a table tag and using different tags can define rows, data and headings. The row is defined by tr, the data is defined by td and the table heading is th. The elements can then be styled either using inline styling which is by using the style attribute in html elements, internet styling which uses a style element in the head section and lastly external styling from a css file (cascading stylesheet).
                            The method i opted for was to use an external stylesheet from which I could style all my items or give them tags to separate them. After this we created an audio file using the onboard microphone and converted it to .m3a and .ogg so it could be read by all devices.
                            We then created an audio element using the audio tag and gave it full controls and no autoplay so the user could choose whether they listen to it or not. Once we completed all this we then optimised our site so it could be read from a lynx browser, by giving each of our link, picture and audio elements a textual secondary description. Once all this was completed we then had a fully functional index.html webpage. From here we could next add many features and expand to new html pages.</p>

                        <p class="comment-text">The second lesson of our NVQ revolved around adding styling as well as some transitional elements to the index.html page to make it look up to a high standard before we moved on to a new one. We began by adding a text effect to any html element. I choose the header and decided to add a b tag to make it stand out in bold. However you can choose italics or sub/superscript all by placing short tags around the word or sentence you would like to style it.
                            It all depends on how much you would like your text to stand out. After this i applied a background colour to my index.html just to make everything stand out a bit better and give the webpage a bit more life. You can also change the background to an image if you would like but it is image to set the properties correctly so that it fills the entire screen.
                            After that we can apply a border to an html element and that border can be dotted, dashed, hidden or several number of border styles. The border can also have many different styles of corners such as rounded. Next we added a hover element which means that whatever element we picked it would do a certain thing when you moused over it. It could change colour, expand, change transparency or anything that uses the hover tag. The next transformation that was added was a rotate and rotateY function to an element.
                            This used along with the hover function means that when i moused over an a button of piece of text that element would rotate on an x and y axis. Finally we consolidated all of what we had placed in our html index.html file and sorted them into lists that could either be unordered or ordered. Within this we would then place buttons which we benefit us in the later stages of development. </p>

                        <p class="comment-text">For the third lesson we used BlueGriffin which is a GUI editor in order to change the layout and some styles of your site very easily without the use for actual code. The website is opened in the editor and then using the features on the editor you can work from there. The editor can also be used to design and edit tables easily. Using this editor i changed the header text, the font, added a new table and then saved the file.
                            Once we were finished with the GUI editor we then took our html page and placed it into the w3 validator which checks the markup validity of Web documents in HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, etc. This is very handy to make sure it conforms to the necessary standards in computing. Finally we used terminal and a site called github from which we would host our webpage. This would involve locating and initialising the files for github and the webpage using terminal.
                            After this we could add new files, commit changes or push these changes to the repository.</p>

                            <p class="comment-text">On the 4th lesson of our NVQ we covered Client servers, protocols, the backbone of the internet, shared domains , cloud computing and RSS. Firstly we learned about client servers which uses a central server where many computers connect the internet or a network. The general hardware and software items we will need is a PC, a network card, a modem, a router and the initial internet browser. There are also several bandwidth technologies that can be used which are PSTN (public switch telephone network) , ISDN (integrated services digital network), and DSL (digital subscriber line). Next we learnt about several protocols which state how data is sent over the internet.
                                Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) defines how packets are created ready to be sent via IP and then put back together by the recipient. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are essentially smaller packets without error checking. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is creating and sending email packets. Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) is the receiving and checking end of email packets. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses TCP/IP to transfer HTML and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) uses TCP/IP to transfer files. Next we learnt about the OSI model which is the Open Systems Interconnection which is a model that defines the networking framework to implement protocols in seven different layers. These layers are (bottom) Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application.
                                After this we learnt about the Internet Backbone which entails point presencing and Point connections. Point-to-Point (PPP) is a data link protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. It can provide connection authentication , transmission and encryption. The internet backbone can therefore be described as principle data routes between large strategically interconnected computer networks and core router on the internet. These data routes are normally hosted by commercial, government and high capacity network centres.
                                Next we looked over Domain Name System (DNS) which is a basically a phonebook for IP addresses using a general naming structure.

                                Example-   	HTTP://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM
                                name	        extension
                                sub-domain
                                prefix
                                domain name

                                Next we moved on to shared domains which uses the sub domain part of the address to use separate parts of a server that has been located via its domain name.  Cloud computing uses a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server.

                                Pros
                                - Improved disaster recovery
                                - Accessibility
                                - Environmentally Friendly

                                Cons
                                - Internet Connectivity Required
                                - On-going costs
                                - Security

                                Finally we concluded with RSS which is really simple syndication. This is a standardised XML format that can be consumed by an aggregator which is essentially a reader.

                                <p class="comment-text">This lesson covered all the legislation that exists over misusing internet based forms of communication. The current legislation at the minute is very vague when it the major details. the 1988  Malicious Communication Act has had to be interpreted to including modern day forms of communication which includes tweets and messages. Trolling online can also be classified as a criminal offence in the modern era. In my opinion this is quite a lot of disparity between current legislation and what is considered ethical online. For example the current legislation does not fully cover laws between adults and minors online as it is very vague with several loop holes. Next we looked at the concept of a distributed workplace which is essentially enabling employees to make better use of the internet and mobile communications to better improve their quality of work. The of VoIP (Voice over internet protocols) and VoIP phones has enabled employees to make calls over the internet to other colleagues as well as host conference calls that means meetings can be attended from several different locations. The use of presencing or presence detection means that the company can keep tabs on each individual employee on their location as long as they agree to use the company provided handset. Next is mobile technology which is a technology that allows transmission of data, voice and video via a computer or any other wireless enabled device without having to be connected to a fixed physical link. This can come also be put in together with technologies like VoIP and the use of VoIP phone. We then discussed call/contact centres which are dedicated centres to take the calls of businesses and their employees as a first line of contact. Once the call has been received through a formal message tailored with the business in hand they will then check if the employee is available to take the call or not. Finally in a distributed workplace we learned about the conversion of voice to text technology which is fairly easy to understand and comprehend. This involves using a mircophone to speak to the device/computer and once the program has been properly set up it will then transfer onto the screen what you said in text. The system can be hard to use at times as it is difficult to train it to understand dialects and accents.
                                    The next section we covered looks at the uprising of social media and how it can be used to their advantage in terms of online presence. Social media can be defined as websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking. An example of a social networking sites are Twitter which is essentially a form of communication site limited to 140 characters which steers the user towards short meaningful messages. Another example is YouTube which is a media sharing platform which allows viewers to either like/dislike or comment under each video giving their opinion on the video. Over the years this has exploded into a wide media platform where content creators have full time jobs producing videos and other content. Another way of communication over the internet is through the use of a blog which is a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style. It is essentially a journal or a diary by either a company or a person that can be read and interpreted by many. The main elements of a blog start with a basic title followed normally by the date and the person who wrote the blog. Within this there is usually sub headings and paragraphs/pictures that can be informative or just as diary purposes. A folksonomy is a system in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding these items.  Next we discussed the elements of a news feed service. This is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. A content provider publishes a web feed link on its site which users then register to the feed and will then be updated regularly with content.

                                    <p class="comment-text">During this lesson we focused on the importance of keeping your network and computer properly maintained in order to prevent an problems further down the line. The first area we will look at is how we will secure our pcs and our servers to prevent them from attacks and if they are attacked how to deal with it. The easiest way to keep a computer up to secure is to keep it up to date allowing the computer to have all the necessary patches that it needs. After this the user should install an intruder detection which monitors for malicious activity as well as policy violations. After this it will be key to close an non essential network ports to prevent any unnecessary attacks. However if staff are well trained and vigilant as to what they are clicking on then they should have no problem to prevent any future attacks and keep the PCs/Servers secure.
                                        After this we looked over what exactly is the standard procedure if you do get attack and how you should take steps to deal with this. Once you notice an attack the most important thing to do is disconnect from the network as WORMs are able to travel across the network to other machines and viruses may leach onto other files. Once this has been done it is now time to act fast and identify where about the attack has come from and what type of an attack it is. If it is internal you should have already disconnected the machine from the network but if it is external you should begin to block the IP. If however it is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which is essentially overloading the system with requests so that it unable to fulfil its main requests and keep up so it eventually goes down. This is very illegal with a maximum 10 years in prison. Once all prior checks have been done begin to back up data incase it gets worse or you are unable to stop it in time. If you have backed it all up this will be vital to stop future attacks as it may give you an insight as to how they entered the system so you can analysis the data and possibly make future changes.

                                        We then discussed what social engineering was and how we would take the necessary steps to prevent any of this happening in the future. A social engineer essentially try to make some believe they are someone else so they hand over confidential information about the business or another user. This can be used to gain access to the business system which can lead to future attacks and destruction either internally or externally. They may also claim to be someone else by stating certain information about your business which is just to lure you into giving them what they want. The best way to start avoiding this is to have a certain level of authentication or security questions that are specifically tailored to the user at hand. If you are contact by someone you could ring that so called persons home number to check legitimacy and this also works if you have been contacted by other companies looking to get information from you. Once you have been contacted by someone it is important to then adjust your security details to prevent someone from attempting to repeat the same action again with possibly better results for them.

                                        After this we began to look at different levels of encryption. These were split into symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. Asymmetric Encryption is a form of Encryption where keys come in pairs. What one key encrypts, only the other can decrypt. The keys are interchangeable, in the sense that if key A encrypts a message, then B can decrypt it, and if key B encrypts a message, then key A can decrypt it. The big difference is that asymmetric algorithms use different keys for encryption and decryption.

                                        Next came authentication principles which break down how a user and the business is kept secure throughout the duration of their session. Each user will have their own account equipped with username and password that will also have extra secure features that include special keys and secure questions that only the user should know the answer to. Once they are in the system each user will have their own level of functionality within the system. For example will have access to a lot more controls than a standard employee would. This adds to the level of security so standard employees do not have free reign of a possible security risk.

                                        After this we learnt about Mobile Device Management which is the term given to managing mobile technology devices that have been handed out for use by the company. There are five main steps that are involved and they are as follows.

                                        Provisioning- This refers to the initial company set up with the network provider
                                        Using- The general use policy that the user must follow in order to treat it as a work device
                                        Maintaining- This is to do with the proper maintenance required to keep the devices hardware and software fully operational for business use.
                                        Monitoring- It is imperative that the company must monitor certain devices as their use should not be abused.
                                        Decommissioning- This is the final stage of the devices life with the user where it is either wiped and set up for new use of it has final reached the end of its life cycle.


                                        After that we discussed the possible security threats than can be face using a cloud based service. A cloud based service involves using the internet to store data on instead of actual stand alone hardware that would only take up space as well as energy. I will do a brief breakdown of several threats that an cloud based service could face throughout their lifetime. The cloud could face attacks from Data breaches which are similar to the threats and attacks that traditional corporate networks face. The exact reason people target cloud servers and data stores is due to the vast amount of data that is actually stored on them as they know once they are in they have access to so much. It is important that companies are well protected against they external attacks as when they are hacked and their data goes missing they may incur a fine or criminal charges placed against them. Another threat that they may face is an internal one which is malicious insiders. These are people who work for the company or have previously worked for the company who decide to try and steal precious data or even take down the system from the inside by deleting essential bits of data. Following on from this can also bring another threat which is permanent data loss. This is essentially when someone has accessed the system they delete key data for good in such a way that it is unable to be recovered. This can also be caused by error from the employer as well if they fail to create adequate backups of all data that is stored. However the data loss can come from the user themselves because if they chose to encrypt all data before it is moved to the cloud they must not loose the key because whenever they lose the key, they lose their data. The final threat that I will describe is DoS (Denial of Service) attacks which involves flooding the the cloud with vast amounts of information and requests all in one go in an attempt to take it down and possibly expose a weak link. Although these attacks can be deadly it is possible to prevent them or report them.

                                        Next we discussed continuous data protection and how it is important to be constantly backing up data in order to prevent loss of data if an attack was to happen. Although it is possible to continuously backup data it does require a large amount of network usage. It is important to prioritise certain data in levels of back up importance. More important data should be backed up more frequently that other types of data. If this data is key to keeping the system running then it is important that it is secured first.

                                        To finish with we then looked at IP Troubleshooting which in order to start this you must check if the computer/machine you are using has TCP/IP enabled as this is important. In order to check if the computer itself has an IP assigned to it you can either use ipconfig for windows and ifconfig for mac. This will display details about the computer as well as the IP you are looking for. To check if it is working you can then use a PING which sends a small packet to a particular IP address in order to check if the network connections are intact. After this you can perform a DIG command which essential performs a DNS(Domain Name System) as another check for whether or not it is properly connected to the network. You can also TRACE ROUTE to see if the network and the intended destination are making the correct connection.</p>

                                        <p class="comment-text">Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain text ; encrypted data is referred to as cipher text. The first major type is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) which intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that or a traditional wired network. Wifi Protected Access (WPA) and Wifi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) are both security protocols and security certification programs developed by the WiFi alliance to secure wireless computer networks. In WPA there is a 256 bit key while WPA2 uses AES encryption.

                                            Next we discussed ways that authentication, digital certificates, encryption and firewalls will provide necessary web security. Authentication allows access control of users systems located on the web. The user will be prompted to enter some form of id or even a username or password. Digital certificates allow for identification of entities on the web. Encryption allows to send data securely over the web using a key in order to convert it to something readable for the user. Finally firewalls prevent malicious things from gaining access to your computer as they are stopped and checked first.

                                            After this we looked at and discussed how encryption helps enforce, data confidentiality, data integrity and non repudiation to secure end users transactions. The idea of encryption is that it only allows the intended recipient to read what the message says. Encryption enforces integrity when it uses a hash that corresponds to the data being sent and therefore if the data was altered would not be able to decrypt successfully. It is very important that once the user receives the key that they do not lose the key as it is the only thing that is able to decrypt their work. After this we discussed the difference between viruses and WORMS. A virus is a piece of code that can copy itself  and make its way along with a file to destroy the rest of a system.  A worm is a lone piece of malware that replicates itself in order to spread among other computers. It uses the computer network to travel along where as a virus needs to attach itself to a program. Once we distinguished the difference we then talked about how we would go about preventing a virus from getting on the system in the first place. Regular updates of all anti virus systems and the OS will help make sure that all the necessary patches are there to stop these viruses and WORMs. A major way to stay safe online is to use common sense when opening files and be very vigilant when connecting to open or free wifi networks as these can be easily manipulated. Updates and patches are software file or bits of code that contains fixes for problems found by other users or the software developer. Installing an update fixes the code and prevents the problems re-occurring.

                                            Once we worked out how to spot and stop a virus we then worked out what to do whenever a virus is either in your system or you suspect one may be in your system. Once you notice a virus it is very important  to completely remove yourself from the network to prevent it from spreading itself across the network to other devices and possibly corrupting your entire system. After this you may run an anti virus scan  and once they have been isolated remove them from the system. If back ups have not been performed by the anti virus system then it is important to back up all essential files. </p>
