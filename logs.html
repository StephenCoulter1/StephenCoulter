                        <p class="comment-text">On the First day of our NVQ we created our first html webpage using a program called phpstorm. Once our main index.html page was created we use a very basic structure and also set the doctype. The doctype describes to the document the document type definition i.e a particular version of HTML. In the index.html we added several elements which includes a header, a paragraph, a table of contents and a link. The paragraph was defined with the p tags.
                            The header was the largest size of header so it was defined as an h1 tag. The next addition was a table of contents which starts off with a table tag and using different tags can define rows, data and headings. The row is defined by tr, the data is defined by td and the table heading is th. The elements can then be styled either using inline styling which is by using the style attribute in html elements, internet styling which uses a style element in the head section and lastly external styling from a css file (cascading stylesheet).
                            The method i opted for was to use an external stylesheet from which I could style all my items or give them tags to separate them. After this we created an audio file using the onboard microphone and converted it to .m3a and .ogg so it could be read by all devices.
                            We then created an audio element using the audio tag and gave it full controls and no autoplay so the user could choose whether they listen to it or not. Once we completed all this we then optimised our site so it could be read from a lynx browser, by giving each of our link, picture and audio elements a textual secondary description. Once all this was completed we then had a fully functional index.html webpage. From here we could next add many features and expand to new html pages.</p>

                        <p class="comment-text">The second lesson of our NVQ revolved around adding styling as well as some transitional elements to the index.html page to make it look up to a high standard before we moved on to a new one. We began by adding a text effect to any html element. I choose the header and decided to add a b tag to make it stand out in bold. However you can choose italics or sub/superscript all by placing short tags around the word or sentence you would like to style it.
                            It all depends on how much you would like your text to stand out. After this i applied a background colour to my index.html just to make everything stand out a bit better and give the webpage a bit more life. You can also change the background to an image if you would like but it is image to set the properties correctly so that it fills the entire screen.
                            After that we can apply a border to an html element and that border can be dotted, dashed, hidden or several number of border styles. The border can also have many different styles of corners such as rounded. Next we added a hover element which means that whatever element we picked it would do a certain thing when you moused over it. It could change colour, expand, change transparency or anything that uses the hover tag. The next transformation that was added was a rotate and rotateY function to an element.
                            This used along with the hover function means that when i moused over an a button of piece of text that element would rotate on an x and y axis. Finally we consolidated all of what we had placed in our html index.html file and sorted them into lists that could either be unordered or ordered. Within this we would then place buttons which we benefit us in the later stages of development. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="comment-text">For the third lesson we used BlueGriffin which is a GUI editor in order to change the layout and some styles of your site very easily without the use for actual code. The website is opened in the editor and then using the features on the editor you can work from there. The editor can also be used to design and edit tables easily. Using this editor i changed the header text, the font, added a new table and then saved the file.
                            Once we were finished with the GUI editor we then took our html page and placed it into the w3 validator which checks the markup validity of Web documents in HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, etc. This is very handy to make sure it conforms to the necessary standards in computing. Finally we used terminal and a site called github from which we would host our webpage. This would involve locating and initialising the files for github and the webpage using terminal.
                            After this we could add new files, commit changes or push these changes to the repository.</p>
