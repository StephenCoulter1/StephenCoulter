\f0\b\fs32 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 System Requirements Test\
\
\
Requirement:\

\b0 \ulnone I wish to test the Help page to see if a user is able to send a feedback email.
\b \ul \
\
Action:\

\b0 \ulnone In order to complete this test I will input a sample email address and text into the small form at the bottom of the help page. If the test goes to plan then I will receive an email containing all the details that have been previously filled in. The page successfully loaded within the time scale that was previously estimated along with all the contents of the page. I was able to enter data into the form and once I pressed the submit button I was then taken to the thank you page which states that i will have received their email and will reply as soon as possible. Shortly after this I received an email which contained the email address of the user and the text that was input into the form. \
\

\b \ul Outcome:\

\b0 \ulnone Pass}
