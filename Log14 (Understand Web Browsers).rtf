\f0\fs36 \cf0 The next part of our NVQ is getting an understanding of different web browsers and their features and plug ins that come with. Firstly we looked at the functions and components of URN and URI which define the name and the location of a resource. The URN is the name of a resource for example using the mail to resource as mailto:example@email.com. The URL is the uniform resource locator which is the location of a resource which would be what you type into your search bar for example http://www.google.com. After this we looked at how to deal with pop ups and external window pop ups that can happen. A lot of these pop ups contain adverts with malicious intent that are out to either gain sensitive information or destroy your computer from the inside. Majority of browsers have internal blockers built in but you are also able to install external ones that will prevent pop ups and adverts from appearing on the webpages you visit. All of this can be found within the plug ins and preferences setting depending on what browser you are using. There are also pieces of software that can be used to prevent all these pop ups from appearing on your computer. \

Next we discussed the functions of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security) and other encryption methods in securing communication for various protocols. Both SSL and TLS are used to transfer encrypted data by using a public key encryption method. There are several other protocols but one of the most common to appear with the two of them is PCT (Private Communications Technology). PCT is a protocol which is designed to provide privacy between two communicating applications such as a client and a server. Once a communication has been met then it will authenticate the server and if needed the client as well. All of these are used to securely send data as well as protocol data. }
